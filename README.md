# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to conduct exploratory analysis to showcase the type of city and number of drivers and riders as well as the % of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city.  The analysis produced would help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for undeserved neighbourhoods.

The Resources folder and PyBer_Challenge.ipynb file will be used for this analysis.

## Results
 
### Analysis of of rides by city type
*Summary of Results.png* in the resources folder will be used for the following three paragraphs. The summary table depicts the difference in ride-sharing data among the different city types.  Ride-sharing data shows that the total number of rides in the urban citis is 13 times more (1,625 rides) than that in the rural (125 rides) and around 5 time more than the suburban (625 rides). The surprising thing is that the number of total drivers in the urban cities are  approximately 30.8 times more (2,405 drivers) than that in the rural cities (78 drivers) and approximately 4.9 times more (490 drivers) than the suburban cities.  The rides to driver ratio is 1 ride to 1.6  drivers in rural cities, 1 ride to 1.3 drivers in suburban cities and 1 ride to 0.7 drivers in urban cities. This shows that there is a higher concentration of drivers in urban cities than that is required / demanded in the cities.  In other words, it is better to be a driver in rural city than an urban one.

### Analysis of fares by city type
The total fare in the urban cities is approximately 9 times more than the rural cities and approximately 2 times more than the suburban cities.  When this data is distributed over to determine the average fare per ride it is determined that the rides are more affordable in urban cities than the rural cities.  An average fare per ride in a rural city and suburban city  is approximately 40% ($34.62) and 27% (#30.97)more respectively than the average ride in the urban city ($24.53).  There could be many reasons for this data.  This could be that most rural cities require the  rider to travel a larger distance to reach their destination, whereas the rider maybe travelling a shorter distance in the urban city.  The average fare per ride however may depict the lack of affordability in rural cities as compared to the suburban and urban cities.  

Again, the average fare per driver is 3.3 timer more ($55.49) in rural city and 2.4 times more ($39.50) in suburban cities than it is in urban cities ($16.57).  This shows that it is better to be a driver in a rural city than it would be in an urban city.

### Analysis of weekly fares by city type
Image file *Total Fare by City Type.png* in the resources folder shows that total weekly fare (USD) for urban cities hover around 1600$ to $2400, for suburban cities around $700 to $1400 and for rural cities around $60 to $500.  The difference between ranges for urban cities and rural cities is drastic.  This could just be because of lower population in rural cities thus lower demand of ride sharing program.

## Recommendations:

Following are some of the recommendations provided to improve the business:

-	Study needs to be conducted to determine if the average fare per ride in the rural location is higher as compared to urban and suburban cities because of the distance travelled or because the rates are higher in rural cities.  If affordability is an issue, the per km rate for the rural city should be decreased.

-	More stringent work should be done to hire drivers in urban cities.  Maybe the total number of drivers working in one area should be capped.

-	Since the total fare is lower consistently in rural areas and more total rides are needed in urban areas, it may be beneficial to look into a promotion campaign where riders get a coupon or a given amount for the first-time, they try the ride share program.  This may introduce and entice more riders to try the program that might be hesitant.

-	For rural areas where longer distances need to be covered, efforts could be made to introduce clean energy vehicles so that more drivers can be recruited.
